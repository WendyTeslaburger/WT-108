# WT-108, a 1 to 8 channel E-stim multiplexer
## About
This projects aims to bring some fun scenarios with 8 channels to your E-stim play. Make use of some preprogrammed examples (note: still need to be written, any contribution is appreciated!) or write your own custom code.

In the future a nice 3D printed case will be designed with room for a battery. Combined with the bluetooth and wifi capabilities of the board, this will effectively remove a bunch of wires from you setup.
